# Requirements Document

## Introduction

การปรับปรุงระบบ Stock Management System ให้พร้อมสำหรับการ deploy บน VPS server ที่จัดการโดย Dokploy โดยไม่มีปัญหา ระบบต้องมีความเสถียร ปลอดภัย และสามารถ scale ได้ในสภาพแวดล้อม production

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to deploy seamlessly on Dokploy, so that I can manage the deployment process efficiently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying via Dokploy THEN the system SHALL build all Docker images successfully without errors
2. WHEN all services start THEN the system SHALL pass all health checks within 2 minutes
3. WHEN accessing the application THEN the frontend SHALL load correctly and connect to the backend API
4. IF any service fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in logs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment variable management, so that I can configure the application securely for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use secure default values for all sensitive configurations
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating required variables
3. WHEN using Dokploy THEN the system SHALL support environment variable injection through Dokploy's interface
4. IF database credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL connect securely using encrypted connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the application to follow security best practices, so that the deployment is secure against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use non-root users in all containers
2. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL include proper security headers
3. WHEN handling sessions THEN the system SHALL use secure cookie settings for HTTPS environments
4. WHEN exposing APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS policies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues quickly and maintain system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for all services
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for CPU, memory, and database connectivity
4. IF a service becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL restart automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want proper database management, so that data is persistent and the database performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL create database schema automatically if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN starting fresh THEN the system SHALL seed initial data including default users and locations
3. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use persistent volumes for database storage
4. WHEN connecting to database THEN the system SHALL handle connection failures gracefully with retries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want proper networking configuration, so that services can communicate securely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use internal Docker networking
2. WHEN serving the frontend THEN the system SHALL proxy API requests correctly to the backend
3. WHEN handling CORS THEN the system SHALL allow configured origins only
4. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized resource usage, so that the application runs efficiently on the VPS server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
2. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching headers
3. WHEN running services THEN the system SHALL use appropriate resource limits
4. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL implement gzip compression for better performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a backup administrator, I want proper data persistence, so that no data is lost during deployments or server restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use named volumes for database persistence
2. WHEN updating the application THEN the system SHALL preserve existing data
3. WHEN containers restart THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
4. IF volumes are configured THEN the system SHALL mount them correctly in Dokploy
